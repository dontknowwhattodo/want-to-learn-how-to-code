help

Still trying to find myself, planning to learn about coding in next year, hope i'll like it.

But this plan may be a bit difficult because of my current studying (i will be graduated like heat power engineer(the way how it taught in my institute is suck))

and more problems can appear because of fact that i am from ukraine, and my english somewhere around intermediate (B1, B2, idk)
